# MinTrainersAlgo
minimum number of trainers who can handle the maximum number of topics

# Problem Statement:
   Trainer recruitment process is going on for the Software Engineering post-graduation programme at BITS Pilani University. The requirement is to hire the minimum number of trainers who can handle the maximum number of topics that are part of the curriculum in the post-graduation programme. Let us assume that a trainer can handle a maximum of 5 topics. The topics are listed below:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Database management (DBMS)
4. Data Science (DS)
5. Data Structures and Algorithm Design (DSAD)
6. Computer Organisation (CO)
7. Data Mining (DM)
8. Mathematical Foundation for Data science (MDS)
   You are required to design a program that can help answer the below queries efficiently.
1. Display the list of names of trainers and the unique list of topics handled by all of them.
2. Calculate the least number of trainers to be recruited to handle all the subjects.
3. Find the list of trainers who can handle a specific topic.
4. If there is a requirement for a trainer who can handle any given topic, is there one single trainer
   who can do that? If yes, whom?
   
# Methods To Implement:
1. def readInput(self, inputfile)
2. def showAll(self)
3. def displayRecruitList(self)
4. def displayTrainers(self, subj)

# Files to be used:
1. inputPS13.txt - as an input file for the program
2. promptsPS13.txt - ??
3. outputPS13.txt - used for flushing the output of every method call

# instruction to run the code
1. import the code into any of the favourite IDE
2. just run the .py file
3. observe the output is captured in outputPS13.txt file

# Algorithm To be used:
As per research above problem is represented as graph in the form of adjacency matrix.
